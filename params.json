{"name":"Simplq","tagline":"","body":"Firefeed\r\n========\r\nFirefeed is a web app that lets users post small messages called *sparks* to\r\ntheir feed. You can follow other users, and their sparks will appear on your\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\n### [Live Demo](http://firefeed.io)\r\n\r\nThe unique property of this application is that it is built entirely using\r\nclient side logic - no server neccessary - other than to serve the static\r\nHTML/CSS/JS files, of course.\r\n\r\nThis is made possible by [Firebase](http://firebase.com/). A detailed explanation\r\nof how the app was built is [available here](http://firefeed.io/about.html).\r\n\r\nNavigating the Code\r\n-------------------\r\nThe core application logic is in www/js/firefeed.js. It is hooked up to the\r\nUI in www/index.html via www/js/firefeed-ui.js.\r\n[firefeed.js](http://github.com/firebase/firefeed/blob/master/www/js/firefeed.js) consists of 11\r\npublic methods, all of which are documented with jsdoc.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to embed a feed like Firefeed into your app, we recommend\r\nimporting firefeed.js and hooking it up to your own UI. Take a look at\r\nfirefeed-ui for an example of how this is done!\r\n\r\n### iOS Client\r\n\r\nAn iOS client is also available. Download the app from the\r\n[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifirefeed/id645597646?mt=8&uo=4)\r\nand browse the [source](https://github.com/firebase/iFirefeed).\r\n\r\nExercises for the reader\r\n------------------------\r\n1. Implement unfollowing a user.\r\n2. Implement protected accounts. If a user opts into a protected account, their\r\nsparks can only be viewed by people they approve.\r\n3. Implement search based on #hashtags. (Hint: Instead of searching for the\r\nactual value through the global list of sparks, consider creating a new bucket\r\nfor every hashtag when it is first used, and then populating it with spark\r\nreferences).\r\n4. Implement retweets, favorites and @ messages to other users. (Hint: You can sort\r\nthe @ messages at creation time for ease of rendering on the consumer side).\r\n5. Implement direct messages. (Hint: Use a mailbox style system between users, and\r\nsetup your rules such that you can write to another user's mailbox but not read\r\nfrom it).\r\n\r\nHelp\r\n----\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to [reach out to us](https://groups.google.com/group/firebase-talk)\r\nif you have questions, comments or suggestions!\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n[MIT](http://firebase.mit-license.org).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
